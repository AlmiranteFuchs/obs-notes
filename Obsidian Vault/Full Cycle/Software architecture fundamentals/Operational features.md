* System needs to be available?
	* How much? Do I need it to be available 24/7? 
		* How much does that would cost?
		
* Critical failures recoveries

* Performance needs to be tuned to project
	* Does it need to be high performance? or it is a low traffic workload?

* Recoveries ( backup )
	* Leave around more than one
	* Test them from time to time
	* Avoid incidents and ransomware

* Security and reliability
	* Are we creating trash?
	* Does ( this ) can be exploited to break our system?
	* Are our endpoints secure?

* Robust
	* If cloud fails, the system can migrate to somewhere that is capable of the workload?
