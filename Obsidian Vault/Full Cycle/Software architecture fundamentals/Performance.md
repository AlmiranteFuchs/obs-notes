"How well a software performs it's workload"

* We grade it by
	* Latency / Response time
	* Throughput / Workload capacity

* Usual performance problems
	* Inefficient process
	* Bad hardware
	* Requests blocking 
	* Serial access to resources

* Usual performance solutions
	* Better [[Computational power]] 
	* Better logic ( Query, overhead, algorithms )
	* [[Concurrency]], [[Parallelism]] 
	* Better data bases
	* [[Caching]]
