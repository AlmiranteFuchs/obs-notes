* ### How Jenkins Works:
- **Automatic Pipeline Trigger**:  
    Whenever thereâ€™s an update to the main code branch, Jenkins automatically initiates the pipeline. This process includes the following steps:
    
    1. **Compiling Code**:  
        The updated code is compiled, ensuring all dependencies and changes are processed correctly.
        
    2. **Running Tests**:  
        Jenkins executes automated tests to validate the correctness and stability of the code, preventing faulty updates from reaching production.
        
    3. **Building the New Version**:  
        A new version of the application is built, incorporating the latest changes and fixes.
        
    4. **Deploying the Application**:  
        Once the build passes all tests, Jenkins deploys the new version to the designated hosting environment or server, making it available for end users.
